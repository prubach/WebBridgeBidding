======================

WebBridgeBidding can load bids from an XLSX file and uses sqlite to persist the data.
The default behaviour is to clear the database at every startup and reload the bids from the bridgeIn.xlsx file
located in the current working directory.

The application can also export bids from an existing database into the bridgeOut.xlsx file located in the
current working directory, however, this behaviour is disabled by default.


The loading/writing and clearing the database can be adjusted by changing the following properties:

webbridge.cleardatabase=true
webbridge.loadBidsFromXlsx=true
webbridge.writeBidsToXlsx=false

These properties can be adjusted in the application.properties in the project or can be provided at runtime as
parameters for the execution of the executable JAR file. For example:

cd build/libs/
java -jar -Dwebbridge.cleardatabase=false -Dwebbridge.loadBidsFromXlsx=false webbridgebidding-0.1.1.jar
